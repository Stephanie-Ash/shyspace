# shyspace

Online networking either socially (via Instagram etc) or for business (via LinkedIn etc) is becoming more and more essential for navigating the world. However it doesn't come naturally to some. ShySpace is a social networking site for the awkward amongst us who are inexperienced in and nervous about social networking. I am aware of the major flaw in an idea that tries to attract people who avoid signing up to or posting on social networks but thought it would be fun to consider what such a site might look like.

## Currently in Development

I am working to build more standard social network features at the moment which will then be adapted to meet the aim of the site.
